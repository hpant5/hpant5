### Industry Data and Machine Learning Systems

Representative work recreated from industry projects (with anonymized data and architectures).

- Churn Prediction and Campaign Automation – Sports Gaming  
  - Built and deployed a user churn prediction model for new users, reducing churn by about 18 percent through automated campaign generation.  
  - Orchestrated data pipelines on Databricks and Airflow to keep features and predictions up to date.

- Financial ETL and Data Applications – EXL  
  - Refactored Spark ETL on AWS Glue, reducing runtime from about 1 hour 40 minutes to about 30 minutes. 
  - Built Python-based data applications and automated data validation with Great Expectations and CI/CD for compliant workflows

- Healthcare ETL Migration – Futurense  
  - Migrated legacy SAS ETL to Spark on Azure, reducing processing from more than 9 hours to less than 1 hour.

You can link to a separate repository that documents these systems with diagrams, sample notebooks, and synthetic data.
